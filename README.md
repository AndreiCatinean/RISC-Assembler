# RISC-Assembler
This repository houses a Python-based assembler tailored for a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) processor architecture, featuring a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI). The GUI allows users to input the file path of their assembly code text, simplifying the assembly process for RISC-based projects.
